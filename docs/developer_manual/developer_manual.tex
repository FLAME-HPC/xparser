\section{Introduction}

The FLAME framework is an enabling tool to create agent-based models that can
be run on high performance computers (HPCs). Models are created based upon
extended finite state machines that include message inputs and outputs. This information
is used by the framework to automatically generate a simulation program that
can run models efficiently on HPCs.
