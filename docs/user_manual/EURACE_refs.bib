burden, measured by the number of calculations needed to find an
equilibrium price, of each system. As the number of agents and commodities increases,
he finds that the bilateral exchange process is less costly than a Walrasian
system. Still, under certain conditions, the equilibria are Pareto optimal although
they may not be in the core.",

  This is based on empirical sociological studies.
  The players form myopic beliefs about the feasability of buildig direct links with their close acquaintences (friends of their friends).
  In an equilibrium network, players play a best-respons to their formed myopic beliefs.
  In the resulting class of equilibrium networks, the players myopic beliefs are confirmed.",

The focus of the model is on the transmission of the effects of economic policy both on the
domestic and the international economy. The new model contains structural models for the EU member
states, the US and Japan and distinguishes 10 additional countries/regions in trade feedback
models in order to model trade interactions with the rest of the world.
The model is backward-looking; although expectations are explicitly modelled, they are generally based on lagged values of the variables concerned, i.e. it uses adaptive expectations.",
