\section{Model Design}
\label{sec:model_design}

The philosophy of FLAME is to specify an agent-based model as you would specify
software behaviour, as ultimately the execution of the model will be in software.
The behaviour model is based upon state machines which are composed of a number
of states with transition functions between those states. There is a single
start state and by traversing states using the transition functions the machine
executes the functions until it reaches an end state. This happens to each
machine as one time step or iteration is completed. Figure
\ref{fig:iteration_1} shows a model consisting of two agents each with two
functions run one after the other. A time step or iteration of the model is when
each agent goes from their start state to an end state.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{iteration_1.eps}
\caption{An iteration with 2 agents with 2 functions each}
\label{fig:iteration_1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Each agent has a memory that holds variables. Transition functions can read and
write to variables in the agent's memory. Communication between agents is
achieved via messages. Transition functions can also read incoming messages and write
outgoing messages. Figure \ref{fig:xmachine} shows an agent machine with a start state, 
an end state and one transition function from one to the other which has access to the 
agent memory and recieves inputs
and produces outputs.

Describing an agent-based model would thus include the following individual
stages for creating a model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Identifying the agents and their functions
\item Identify the states which impose some order of function execution
\item Identify the memory as the set of variables that are accessed by
functions \\(including possible conditions on variables for the functions to
occur)
\item Identify the input messages and output messages of each function 
\\(including possible filters on inputs)

\end{itemize}

Once a model has been defined using these criteria the implementation of the
agent functions can be written as source code in the C programming language.
FLAME can then use the model description to create a simulation program that
handles agent execution and communication in parallel.

\subsection{Swarm Example}

For example a simple swarm (flocking) model would include an agent for a bird.
Because agents can only communicate via messages in FLAME each bird needs to
have a function that sends out a message with their current location. A second
function is needed to read the messages and update the birds velocity depending
on the other birds locations. A third function then updates the birds location
using the birds new velocity. The three functions required of the bird agent are
then:

\begin{itemize}
\item signal -- send out current position message
\item observe -- read position messages from other agents and update velocity
\item respond -- update position using the current velocity
\end{itemize}

The functions occur in this order so states are included to impose this
order, see Figure \ref{fig:swarm_1}. As a requirement for automatic parallel
execution agents can only enter particular states once during an iteration,
i.e. there cannot be any loops back to a state already entered. This is so that
parallel processes can easily stay synchronised, adding to the efficiently of a
simulation. There can only be one start state per agent, but there can be many
possible end states.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{swarm_1.eps}
\caption{Swarm model including states}
\label{fig:swarm_1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Functions can also have conditions. For instance, in
the swarm model, a response function for flying and a response function when
resting on the ground. The condition on the flying response function would be that the
z-axis position of the agent be greater than zero while the resting response
function condition would be when the z-axis position was zero, see Figure
\ref{fig:swarm_2}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{swarm_2.eps}
\caption{Swarm model including function conditions}
\label{fig:swarm_2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The messages required for communication between agents are a signal message,
which is output from `signal' and input to `observe', see Figure
\ref{fig:swarm_3}. This message would include the position of the agent that
sent it, see Table \ref{tab:signal_message}. A feature of swarm models and most
agent-based models is that there is generally a limit on incoming communication. 
In the swarm case this is the perceived distance of sight that an agent can view the location of other
agents. This feature can be added to the model as a filter on inputs to a
function, where the filter is a formula involving the position contained in the
message (the position of the sending agent) and the receiving agent position.

\begin{tabular}{|l||c||l|}
\hline
Type&Name&Description\\
\hline \hline

\hline

\end{tabular}

\label{tab:signal_message}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{swarm_3.eps}
\caption{Swarm model including messages}
\label{fig:swarm_3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Functions that take a message type as input are only executed once all functions
that output the same message type have finished. One iteration is taken as a
standalone run of a simulation, so once all the functions that have a message
type as an input have been executed, the messages are deleted as they are no
longer required. Messages cannot be sent between iterations.

Finally the memory required by the agent functions include the position of the
agent, and its velocity, as shown in Table \ref{tab:swarm_memory}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l||c||l|}
\hline
Type&Name&Description\\
\hline \hline

\hline
double&py&position in y-axis\\
\hline

\hline
double&vz&velocity in z-axis\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Swarm Agent Memory}
\label{tab:swarm_memory}
\end{table}

The swarm model can also be represented as a transition table, see Table
\ref{tab:swarmtransition}, where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Current State -- is the state the agent is currently in.
  \item Input -- is any inputs into the transition function.
  \item $M_{pre}$ -- are any preconditions of the memory on the transition.
  \item Function -- is the function name.
  \item $M_{post}$ -- is any change in the agent memory.
  \item Output -- is any outputs from the transition.
  \item Next State -- is the next state that is entered by the agent.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c||c|c|c|}
\hline

Section \ref{sec:model_description} on model description describes how to write
a model description into an XML file that FLAME can understand. Section
\ref{sec:model_implementation} on model implementation describes how to
implement the individual agent functions, i.e. $M_{post}$ from the transition table.
Section \ref{sec:model_execution} on model execution describes how to use the
tools in FLAME to generate a simulation program, compile it, and run it.

% \begin{equation}\label{streamxmachine}
%     X = (\Sigma, \Gamma, Q, M, \Phi, F, q_{0}, m_{0})
% \end{equation}
% where,
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\Sigma$ are the set of input alphabets
% \item $\Gamma$ are the set of output alphabets
% \item $Q$ denotes the set of states
% \item $M$ denotes the variables in the memory.
% \item $\Phi$ denotes the set of partial functions $\phi$ that map
% and input and memory variable to an output and a change on the
% memory variable. The set $\phi$: $\Sigma \times M\ \longrightarrow\
% \Gamma\times M$
% \item $F$ in the next state transition function, $F : Q \times\phi\longrightarrow
% Q$
% \item $q_{0}$ is the initial state and $m_{0}$ is the initial memory
% of the machine.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsection{Transition Function}
% The transition functions allow the agents to change the state in
% which they are in, modifying their behaviour accordingly. These would
% require as inputs their current state $s_{1}$, current memory value
% $m_{1}$, and the possible arrival of a message that the agent is able to
% read, $t_{1}$. Depending on these three values the agent can then
% change to another state $s_{2}$, updates the memory to $m_{2}$ and
% optionally sends a message, $t_{2}$. Figure
% \ref{fig:trans} depicts how the transition function
% works within the agent.
% 
% % \begin{figure}
% % \begin{center}
% % \includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{transfn.eps}
% % \caption{Transition function} \label{fig:trans}
% % \end{center}
% % \end{figure}
% 
% 
% Extended finite state machines or X-Machines are used to define agents within a
% model. 
% The basic definition of an
% agent would thus, in accordance to the computational model, contain
% the following components:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item A finite set of internal states.
%  \item A set of transition functions that operate between states.
%  \item An internal memory set. In practice, the memory would be a finite set and can be structured in any way required.
%  \item A language for sending and receiving messages between other agents.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% 
% Some of the transition functions may not depend on the incoming
% message. Thus the message would then be represented as:
% \begin{equation}\label{msg}
%     Message = \{ \emptyset, <data> \}
% \end{equation}
% 
% These agent transition functions may be expressed in terms of
% stochastic rules, thus allowing the multi-agent systems to be termed
% as stochastic systems.
% 
% \subsubsection{Memory and States}
% The difference between the internal set of states and the internal
% memory set allows for added flexibility when modelling systems.
% There can be agents with one internal state and all the complexity
% defined in the memory or equivalently, there could be agents with
% a trivial memory with the complexity then bound up in a large state
% space. There are good examples of choosing an appropriate balance
% between these two as this enables the complexity of the models to be
% better managed.
